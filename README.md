# Predicting-Vaccine-Uptake-Using-Machine-Learning

Introduction

This project aims to predict individuals' likelihood of receiving the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using machine learning models. Using a dataset from DrivenData that includes demographic, behavioral, and health-related features, we frame this as a classification problem. Logistic Regression and Decision Trees are used to build predictive models, with performance evaluated using metrics such as ROC-AUC. The project demonstrates the full data science pipeline, from preprocessing to model interpretation, providing insights into factors influencing vaccine uptake. These findings can inform targeted public health strategies to improve vaccination rates and address vaccine hesitancy

Business Problem

Despite the availability of vaccines, many individuals choose not to receive them, leaving communities vulnerable to seasonal flu outbreaks and pandemics like H1N1. Public health organizations need to understand the factors influencing vaccination uptake to design effective, targeted interventions.

Key Business Questions:

1. What factors influence an individual's likelihood to receive the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines?
2. How can predictive modeling help identify high-risk groups who are less likely to vaccinate?
3. What actionable strategies can public health organizations implement to increase vaccination rates?

Objectives

To develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of individuals receiving two specific vaccines: the H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.

Data

The data for this competition comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/data/

The source dataset comes with the following data use restrictions:
1. Use the data in these data files for statistical reporting and analysis only.
2. Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any such discovery (1 (800) 232-4636).
3. Not link these data files with individually identifiable data from other NCHS or non-NCHS data files.
